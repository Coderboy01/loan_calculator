## Logic Behind the Loan Calculator

The loan calculator uses a common financial formula to calculate the monthly payment for a loan. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works:

### Formula:

The monthly payment is calculated using the amortization formula:

\[
M = \frac{P \times r \times (1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
\]

Where:
- M is the monthly payment.
- P is the principal loan amount.
- r is the monthly interest rate (the annual interest rate divided by 12).
- n is the total number of payments (the loan term in years multiplied by 12).

### Process:

1. Input Values:
   - Loan Amount: The total loan amount to be borrowed.
   - Interest Rate: The annual interest rate, entered as a percentage.
   - Repayment Period: The loan term in years.

2. Calculation:
   - The formula calculates the monthly payment, which is based on the amount borrowed, the interest rate, and the length of the loan.
   - Total Payment is derived by multiplying the monthly payment by the number of months.
   - Total Interest is obtained by subtracting the loan principal from the total payment.

## How to Use

1. Enter Loan Information:
   - Input the loan amount you wish to borrow (e.g., 25,000).
   - Input the annual interest rate (e.g., 2%).
   - Enter the loan term in years (e.g., 1 year).

2. Click "Calculate":
   - The calculator will instantly display the monthly payment, total payment, and total interest below the input fields.

3. Reset the Inputs:
   - You can reset the input fields and try other loan parameters as needed.
